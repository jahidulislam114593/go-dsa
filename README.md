# go-dsa 🧠🚀

A personal repository for practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using the **Go programming language**.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is created with two key goals in mind:

1. **Strengthen Core Programming Skills:**  
   - Practice and implement essential DSA topics in Go.
   - Solve classic problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.
   - Improve problem-solving ability and algorithmic thinking with Go's clean syntax and performance.

2. **Commit Like a Pro:**  
   - Follow **industry-standard Git commit practices**.
   - Write clean, semantic, and consistent commit messages.
   - Simulate real-world software engineering discipline even in personal projects.

## 💡 Commit Message Convention

This project uses the **Conventional Commits** format:

- feat(array): implement two sum with optimal approach
- fix(search): correct index bug in binary search
- refactor(sort): improve bubble sort time complexity
- docs(tree): explain in-order traversal in detail
- test(dp): add test cases for fibonacci memoization
